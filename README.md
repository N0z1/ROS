# ROS wall traveller: Autonomous Wall-Following Robot




## Project Overview

This repository contains my implementation of an autonomous wall-following robot, developed as part of my robotics coursework. The project demonstrates practical application of control systems theory, specifically PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) control, in autonomous robotics.

The robot maintains a constant distance of 1 meter from walls using sensor feedback and PID control loops, showcasing both theoretical understanding and practical implementation skills in robotics and control systems.
## Key Technical Achievements

Implemented a PID controller for precise wall-following behavior.

Achieved stable maintenance of 1-meter distance from walls with minimal oscillation.

Developed robust obstacle avoidance using sensor fusion.

Successfully simulated and tested in Jetson Gazebo environment.

Demonstrated practical application of ROS and C++ in robotics.

## Project Demo
